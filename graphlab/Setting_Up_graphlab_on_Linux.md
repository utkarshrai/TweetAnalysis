The first step is installing Anaconda 2(the link is given on the page)/3. I already had anaconda3 I still needed to fetch
some files to configure it. Follow the link on the website to get the sh version of the package.
 Let's execute from STEP 3.

Errors that might pop up: 

connda:command not found

FIX: Use command: export PATH = ~/anaconda/bin:$PATH

The "conda create -n gl-env python=2.7 anaconda=4.0.0" will require certain libraries. Let them install.

pip install --upgrade --no-cache-dir https://get.graphlab.com/GraphLab-Create/2.1/your registered email address here/your product key here/GraphLab-Create-License.tar.gz

The tab is tp hide my keys, ping if you can still see them.
